Team member contribution

In this section we describe the contribution of each member to the overall project. We will divide it in two groups, code and report. 

Code

The contributions for the code have been:

   - Philippe Van Ameronggen
 
       -  Main algorithm that simulates the SIS behaviour with the different agents and policies described. (SecNet.py)
        
        - BBVA simulated network generation. (BBVA/gen.py)
        
        - Parallelization of all the functions to use the multiple cores of a machine.
        
        - High level overview
        
        - Agent-based model implementations
        
    
    
   - Ramon Mir Mora
    
        
        -  Functions that use the main algorithm to compute some the results in \ref{Results}. Mainly, all the failure cascades/risk code (cascades.py), the average default density evolution compared over multiple delays (sis\_delay\_comparison.py) and the sectorial behaviour (sectorial\_density\_functions.py and the sectorial part in plots\_sis.py). 
        
        - ER and BA model networks generation. (gen.py in each folder)
        
        - Agent-based model implementations
        
      
    
   - Sergi Sánchez de la Blanca Contreras
    
        
        - Code to perform the Monte-Carlo simulations (replicate\_density.py and the rest of plots\_sis.py) 
        
        -  All the Simulation execution 
        
        - Agent-based model implementations
        
       -  Refining and cleaning code
